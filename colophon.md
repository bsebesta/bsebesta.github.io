This site was designed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The underlying code is very simple, but lovingly tended, HTML and CSS. The fonts used are Sorkin Font's [Merriweather](https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather) and Julieta Ulanovsky's [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat).

The idea of a "digital garden" is inspired by Tom Critchlow's 2019 post [Building a Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). My two favorite articles on the concept of "digital gardening" include Maggie Appleton's [A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).
