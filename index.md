My name is Bryan Sebesta. I'm a UX designer working at [RAIN Agency](http://www.rain.agency). Place-wise, I'm kind of homeless right now. Before the pandemic I was in New York City; now I'm living between Sacramento, CA and Salt Lake City, UT, wondering when this pandemic will end and where I'll be once it does.

This is my little corner of the internet. A digital garden, blog, and site for experimentation. I enjoy designing and coding, writing and reading.
