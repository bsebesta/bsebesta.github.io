I"«<p>My name is Bryan Sebesta. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a UX designer working at <a href="http://www.rain.agency">RAIN Agency</a>. Place-wise, Iâ€™m kind of homeless right now. Before the pandemic I was in NYC! Now Iâ€™m living between Sacrament, CA and Salt Lake City, UT, wondering when this pandemic will end and where Iâ€™ll be once it does.</p>

<p>If you want to reach out, say hello!</p>
