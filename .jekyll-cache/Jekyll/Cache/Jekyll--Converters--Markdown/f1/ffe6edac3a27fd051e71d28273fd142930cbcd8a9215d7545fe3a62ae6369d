I"’<p>Dan Cohenâ€™s <a href="https://dancohen.org/2018/03/21/back-to-the-blog/">â€œBack to the Blogâ€</a> makes a really interesting point: centralized services like Twitter and Facebook have a strong sense of <em>ambient humanity</em>, â€œthe feeling that â€˜others are hereâ€™â€“that is often missing when one writes on oneâ€™s own site.â€ This explains why Iâ€™m drawn, so often, to return to social mediaâ€“and depart from projects like this, where the â€œambient humanityâ€ is less. I have to remind myself: <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/scale-is-the-enemy/">scale is the enemy</a> of community and fellowship. And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m really here.</p>
