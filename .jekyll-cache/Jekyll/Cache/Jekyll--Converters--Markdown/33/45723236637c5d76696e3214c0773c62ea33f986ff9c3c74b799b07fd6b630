<p>What am I doing now? For me, December is characterized by a slowness, led on by Advent. So I am trying to slow down and focus more on Christ.</p>

<p>As far as personal digital experiments go, I’m coming to a close on my annual update of <a href="bryansebesta.com">my portfolio</a>. I’m also enjoying updating this site you’re looking at, taking inspiration from other digital gardens and blogs. It’s fun to refresh my web development skills, diving into the CSS grid, Jekyll, and terminal.</p>
