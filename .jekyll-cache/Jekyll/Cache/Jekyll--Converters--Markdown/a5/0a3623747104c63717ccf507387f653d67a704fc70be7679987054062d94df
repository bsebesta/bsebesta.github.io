I"¼<p>A few weeks ago, Ashley (my wife) asked me to play with her niece and nephews. To be honest, I wasnâ€™t really in the mood: I was more interested in a website project I was working on, getting lost in documentation about statically-generated websites and the CSS grid. And because I didnâ€™t <em>want</em> to, I didnâ€™t want to be inauthentic and be a bad playmate. But as usual, her advice was well-taken; I relented, closing up my laptop and going out to just <em>play</em>. And Iâ€™m glad I did: it was a blast, as those kids are <em>wonderful</em>. Some lines that came to my mind, thinking about the experience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my heartâ€™s not in it,
What good will it do.
But if I donâ€™t push through it
How will my heart come to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was reminded of the fact, a fact I have to relearn every day, that â€œwe become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each dayâ€ (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/10/the-transforming-power-of-faith-and-character?lang=eng">link</a>). I didnâ€™t want to play until I did, and in so doing, I became a more playful person. Iâ€™m reminded of this wonderful point by James K.A. Smith:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you are what you love and if love is a virtue, then love is a habit. This means that our most fundamental orientation to the worldâ€”the longings and desires that orient us toward some version of the good lifeâ€”is shaped and configured by imitation and practiceâ€¦ We learn to loveâ€¦ not primarily by acquiring information about what we should love but rather through practices that form the habits of how we love. These sorts of practices are â€œpedagogiesâ€ of desire, not because they are like lectures that inform us, but because they are rituals that form and direct our affections. ( <em>You Are What You Love</em> )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a world that is very career- and work-centered, Iâ€™m grateful for play, and for my niece and nephews, and for my wifeâ€™s gentle encouragement. I think play is one of the best â€œpedagogies of desire,â€ for the simple reason that chasing my nephew on the slide or pushing those kids on a swing has no end but for the fun of it.</p>
