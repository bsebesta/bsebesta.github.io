I"­<p>Tom Critchlowâ€™s visual essay about â€œThinking in Publicâ€ is fascinating. The actual material is in a Figma file which allows his thinking to be linear and sprawling.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve occasionally been asked to contribute thought leadership, and itâ€™s always been hard. Sitting down to do â€œthought leadershipâ€ has always caused a roadblock. But Tom reframes this. Itâ€™s not about â€œthought leadership.â€ Itâ€™s about being curious, in public. Asking questions. Sharing these questions and curiosities with a small network of trusted people. â€œShowing the sawdust,â€ the side-effects of your learning and work. Developing a distinctiveness. Referencing your own previous writing and work, creating networks of thoughtsâ€“digital. Rework, release.</p>

<p>It was stimulating for me to read, and has helped clarify for myself why Iâ€™m bloggingâ€“and microbloggingâ€“in the first place. Iâ€™m thinking, curiously, in public.</p>
