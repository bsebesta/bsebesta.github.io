I"û<p>Well, Iâ€™m a developer now. Thatâ€™s how it works, no? You find yourself enmeshed in terms like â€œCIâ€ and â€œGitâ€ and â€œLiquid programmingâ€ and â€œStatically generated website,â€ and suddenlyâ€”like magicâ€”youâ€™re a developer!</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s how it feels, anyway. And itâ€™s fun. In my high school days, I used to stay after for long hours, programming a website. I havenâ€™t pulled the long â€œdeveloper hoursâ€ in years, and now that I am, I ask myself: why not? Itâ€™s so much fun.</p>
