I"ï<p>My name is Bryan Sebesta. Iâ€™m a UX designer working at <a href="http://www.rain.agency">RAIN Agency</a>. Place-wise, Iâ€™m kind of homeless right now. Before the pandemic I was in New York City; now Iâ€™m living between Sacramento, CA and Salt Lake City, UT, wondering when this pandemic will end and where Iâ€™ll be once it does.</p>

<p>This is my little corner of the internet. A digital garden, blog, and site for experimentation. I enjoy designing and coding, writing and reading.</p>
