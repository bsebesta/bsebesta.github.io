# Site Notes

This is my website's [philosophy.txt](https://garrickvanburen.com/yes-all-software-should-have-a-philosophy-txt-file/), my [site notes](https://www.patrickrhone.net/site-notes/), my rules and regulations for my little site and all that's on it.

* This will be where I put everything I write from now on. In Indieweb terms, I'm going full [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), an acronym that stands for "Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere."

* While I technically have a blog here, this site isn't primarily a blog. It's more a digital garden: tended, curated, growing up organically. The idea of a "digital garden" is inspired by Tom Critchlow's 2019 post [Building a Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). My two favorite articles on the concept of "digital gardening" include Maggie Appleton's [A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

### Colophon

This site was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The underlying code is very simple, but lovingly tended, HTML and CSS. The fonts used are from Martin Majoor's [Scala](http://www.martinmajoor.com/1_scala.html) family, in both the serif and sans-serif varieties.
