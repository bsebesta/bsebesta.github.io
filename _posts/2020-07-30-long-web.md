Really enjoyed [this article](https://adactio.com/articles/1522/) on the Long Web. Favorite parts:

1. **Reframing the web:** It's useful now. But will we be able to get our stuff in 100 years? Longevity, portability, accessibility–these are the main criteria for how we should be storing things for "the Long Web.”

2. **Reference to Benedictine Monks.** A callout to the early Christian monks who preserved classical works after the Roman Empire fell. I had never compared their experience with our own in this way. I also loved the quote from an anonymous monk from the margins of a parchment:

> My hand is weary with writing, my sharp quill is not steady, my slender, beaked pen juts forth a black draught of shining, dark blue!
