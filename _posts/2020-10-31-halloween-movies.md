My favorite Halloween movies are eclectic: [Song of the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrhoOzW8oF8&ab_channel=StudiocanalUK), [Spirited Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXuk9QqQkk&ab_channel=MadmanAnime), and [Nightmare Before Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3q7jlg3CxI&ab_channel=DisneyMoviesOnDemand). For me, animation captures the spirit of the day better than live-action (though I do love Hocus Pocus and Ghostbusters).
