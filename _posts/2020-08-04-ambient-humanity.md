title: The Ambient Humanity of Twitter and Facebook
---
Dan Cohen's ["Back to the Blog"](https://dancohen.org/2018/03/21/back-to-the-blog/) makes a really interesting point: centralized services like Twitter and Facebook have a strong sense of _ambient humanity_, “the feeling that ‘others are here’–that is often missing when one writes on one's own site." This explains why I'm drawn, so often, to return to social media–and depart from projects like this, where the "ambient humanity" is less. I have to remind myself: [scale is the enemy](https://blog.ayjay.org/scale-is-the-enemy/) of community and fellowship. And that's why I'm really here.
