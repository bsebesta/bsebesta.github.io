title: Thinking Curiously in Public
---
Tom Critchlow's [visual essay about “Thinking in Public"](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) is fascinating. The actual material is in [a Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/qFvsTtQ85fY1UZl78K5tY2/Thinking-in-Public?node-id=0%3A1) which allows his thinking to be linear _and_ sprawling.

I've occasionally been asked to contribute thought leadership, and it's always been hard. Sitting down to do "thought leadership" has always caused a roadblock. But Tom reframes this. It's not about “thought leadership." It's about being curious, in public. Asking questions. Sharing these questions and curiosities with a small network of trusted people. "Showing the sawdust," the side-effects of your learning and work. Developing a distinctiveness. Referencing your own previous writing and work, creating networks of thoughts–digital. Rework, release.

It was stimulating for me to read, and has helped clarify for myself why I'm blogging–and microblogging–in the first place. **I'm thinking, curiously, in public.**
