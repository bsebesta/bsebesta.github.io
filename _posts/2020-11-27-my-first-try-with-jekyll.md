Well, I'm a developer now. That's how it works, no? You find yourself enmeshed in terms like "CI" and "Git" and "Liquid programming" and "Statically generated website," and suddenly—like magic—you're a developer!

That's how it feels, anyway. And it's fun. In my high school days, I used to stay after for long hours, programming a website. I haven't pulled the long "developer hours" in years, and now that I am, I ask myself: why not? It's so much fun.
