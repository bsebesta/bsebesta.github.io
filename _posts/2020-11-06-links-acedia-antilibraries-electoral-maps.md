**[Wesley Schultz's New Album](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Jup9Ntz_AZmKAp_qb2chw).** I'm a huge fan of the Lumineers, where Wesley Shultz is lead singer. His new solo album just debuted. I haven't listened to the whole thing, but so far, promising!

**[Structurally Induced Acedia](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/structurally-induced-acedia).** L.M. Sacasas' latest newsletter looks at how our current information hellscape can cause _acedia_, "the medieval term for the vice of listlessness, apathy, and a general incapacity to do what one ought to do." As someone who struggles with managing attention, this hit home!

**[Building an Antilibrary](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary).** This reframes how I think about all the books I've collected but have't read. "Unread books can be as powerful as the ones we have read, if we choose to consider them in the right light." Not that I needed more justification for buying books, but ¯\_(ツ)_/

**[Try to Impeach This](http://try-to-impeach-this.jetpack.ai/).** A really interesting exploration of different ways to visualize elections. See also [this Fast Company article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90572489/u-s-election-maps-are-wildly-misleading-so-this-designer-fixed-them), which tells the backstory.

**[How to Be Alone](https://kottke.org/10/09/how-to-be-alone).** A really affecting poem, read and performed by Tanya Davis. It reminds meof the Paul Tillich quote: "Our language has wisely sensed these two sides of man’s being alone. It has created the word 'loneliness' to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word 'solitude' to express the glory of being alone."
