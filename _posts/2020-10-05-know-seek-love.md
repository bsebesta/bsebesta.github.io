<h1>What We Know, What We Love, What We Seek</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/the-love-of-god">Dieter F. Uchtdorf:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>For what we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are﻿—and who we will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A world that seems to give us infinite choice actually makes choice nearly impossible: <em>the informational context chooses for us.</em> And what that means—Rousseau brings us something new here, something essential—is that our web of information determines what we <em>love</em>. Thus Saint-Preux: from day to day, "I cannot be sure what I love."</p>
