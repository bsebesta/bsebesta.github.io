<h2>Thinking Curiously in Public</h2>
<p>Tom Critchlow’s <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/">visual essay about “Thinking in Public”</a> is fascinating. The actual material is in <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/qFvsTtQ85fY1UZl78K5tY2/Thinking-in-Public?node-id=0%3A1">a Figma file</a> which allows his thinking to be linear <em>and</em> sprawling.</p>

<p>I’ve occasionally been asked to contribute thought leadership, and it’s always been hard. Sitting down to do “thought leadership” has always caused a roadblock. But Tom reframes this. It’s not about “thought leadership.” It’s about being curious, in public. Asking questions. Sharing these questions and curiosities with a small network of trusted people. “Showing the sawdust,” the side-effects of your learning and work. Developing a distinctiveness. Referencing your own previous writing and work, creating networks of thoughts–digital. Rework, release.</p>

<p>It was stimulating for me to read, and has helped clarify for myself why I’m blogging–and microblogging–in the first place. <strong>I’m thinking, curiously, in public.</strong></p>
