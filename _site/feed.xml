  &lt;p&gt;“It may be that when we no longer know what to do we have come to our real work, and that when we no longer know which way to go we have come to our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are﻿—and who we will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A world that seems to give us infinite choice actually makes choice nearly impossible: &lt;em&gt;the informational context chooses for us.&lt;/em&gt; And what that means—Rousseau brings us something new here, something essential—is that our web of information determines what we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;. Thus Saint-Preux: from day to day, &quot;I cannot be sure what I love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
