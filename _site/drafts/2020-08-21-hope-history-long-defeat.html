<h2>Hope and History and the "Long Defeat"</h2>
<p>I loved Joe Biden’s Seamus Heaney quote from his DNC speech last night. It’s apparently from Heaney’s verse adaptation of a Sophocles play, <em>A Cure at Troy</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>History says, Don’t hope
On this side of the grave,
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up,
And hope and history rhyme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me of <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/a-long-defeat-a-final-victory/">Alan Jacobs’ essay on “The Long Defeat.”</a>. He draws the phrase from Galadriel in J.R.R. Tolkein’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, and quotes a letter from Tolkein explaining what it means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a Christian, and indeed a Roman Catholic, so that I do not expect ‘history’ to be anything but a ‘long defeat’–though it contains (and in a legend may contain more clearly and movingly) some samples or glimpses of final victory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heaney’s quote seems to be getting at the same thing. History is messy, and viewed through Heaney’s lens, it teaches us not to hope. But–every once in a while–”justice can rise up,” giving us “samples or glimpses of final victory.” ‘Tis a beautiful idea, and I thank Joe Biden for bringing it to my remembrance.</p>
